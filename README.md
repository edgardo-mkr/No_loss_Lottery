TICKET COST
10$(~10 stablecoin) per ticket

NOTE
it is not necessary to install chainlink contracts because inside "contracts/" there is already a custom version of the chainlink random number generator oracle
that serves as a mock contract of the original oracle(helpful for the forked mainnet tests) and is upgradable camplaint.
